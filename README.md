# GAJENDRA_ALU
<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



In this Project we will implement a Processor called Gajendra ALU which can implement almost all necessary basic operations.For better understanding this design is made using CircuitVerse

I have attached two detailed pdfs about the approach and the instructions that can be done using this ALU



### Built With

This project mainly based on CircuitVerse



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Create a CircuitVerse account for saving the file for later use your personal id if needed

<!-- MUST READ -->
## CircuitVerse file

The design can be obtained from the ALU folder


## MUST READ

Also ,Make sure to read both file from the helperfile.The detailed explanation of each components used in the circuit is given in Guide.pdf .
